This simulation is very buggy fyi

Move the dot around the screen
You will notice time moves slower further from the centre
Every object has its own relative time
Space bar shoots bullets

Press 'r' to reverse time.
  - Pressing 'r' will resume time but you will move to a new timeline
  - Other timelines are rendered with coloured borders to differentiate them.

Oh and remember time is spatial so it gets really confusing if you move around a lot, shoot and rewind.

And it's a pain to test!

And its a prototype so the code is as confusing as the concept.
